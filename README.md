## 📍 About This Repository

This repository is a **personal learning archive** created during my journey in the ChaiCode Cohort.

What you’ll find here:

- 📚 Notes & resources from cohort sessions
- ✍️ Blogs written to solidify concepts
- 🧪 Assignments and hands-on exercises
- 🛠️ Applications built while learning

Nothing here is _perfect code_.  
Everything here is **intentional progress**.

If this repository helps you even a little — that’s a win for both of us 😄
